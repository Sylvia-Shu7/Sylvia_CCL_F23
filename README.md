here you can read my code:https://github.com/Sylvia-Shu7/Sylvia_CCL_F23/
and this is the live version of it on Github Page:https://sylvia-shu7.github.io/Sylvia_CCL_F23/

this is the root, or the base of my cclab folder,
if you see this on a url that looks like sylvia-shu7.github.io/repo-name
then you can append project/website/folder names to the url to get to the actual webpages
